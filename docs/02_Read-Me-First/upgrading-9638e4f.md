# Upgrading

Before upgrading to a newer SAPUI5 version, in general, you must first ensure that your development follows the documented compatibility guidelines strictly such as:

-   **[Compatibility Rules](compatibility-rules-91f0873.md)**

-   **[Use Only Public APIs](../03_Get-Started/use-only-public-apis-b0d5fe2.md)**

-   **[Coding Issues to Avoid](../05_Developing_Apps/coding-issues-to-avoid-3877872.md)**

-   **[The Owner Component](../04_Essentials/the-owner-component-a7a3138.md)**

-   For SAPUI5 applications based on SAP Fiori elements: **[Read Before Extending a Generated App](../06_SAP_Fiori_Elements/read-before-extending-a-generated-app-d9c146a.md)**


Afterwards, refer to the following version specific sections that describe what else you have to consider.
