# Key User Adaptation

The `SmartVariantManagement` control is enabled for key user adaptation.

`SmartVariantManagement` can be used for key user changes. All changes are then stored in the CUSTOMER layer of the layered repository of SAPUI5 flexibility.

> ### Note:  
> On the user interfaces for key and end users, the more user-oriented term "view" is used for variants.

The following list shows the changes that a key user can make in the UI adaptation mode:

-   Create, save, delete, and rename views

-   Define default views

-   Define favorites

-   Apply views automatically

-   Define the visibility of views \(visible for all users or only for users with a specific role\)

-   Standard views:

    -   Define default standard views

    -   Apply standard views automatically


    > ### Note:  
    > The key user cannot rename or delete standard views; define favorites, define visibility, or change the content of the related controls for these views.


A `SmartVariantManagement` control that is enabled for key user adaptation can be used together with the following controls:

-   `SmartFilterBar`

-   `SmartTable`

-   `SmartChart`


These controls need to be enabled for key user adaptation. For more information, see **Key User Adaptation** in [Smart Variant Management](smart-variant-management-06a4c3a.md#loio06a4c3ac1cf545a7b51864e7f3aa02da__SVM_KUA).
