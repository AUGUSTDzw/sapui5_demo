# The SAPUI5 ABAP Repository and the ABAP Back-End Infrastructure

The SAPUI5 ABAP repository is used to store SAPUI5 apps, components, and libraries. SAP uses it for delivering various types of SAPUI5 apps, for example SAP Fiori or High Performance Analytics \(HPA\) apps. The SAPUI5 ABAP repository can also be used by customers to store their own SAPUI5 apps and extension projects.

> ### Note:  
> This chapter is only relevant if you're using the SAPUI5 ABAP repository and the ABAP back-end infrastructure.

The SAPUI5 ABAP repository is part of the SAPUI5 ABAP back-end infrastructure and is the umbrella term for the single SAPUI5 repository of each application. Technically, this infrastructure is based on the Business Server Page \(BSP\) repository and each SAPUI5 repository is represented by an individual BSP application.

> ### Caution:  
> For data integrity reasons, don't modify content of the SAPUI5 ABAP repository directly by editing the corresponding BSP applications in ABAP Workbench \(transaction `SE80`\). For more information, see [Technical Remarks](technical-remarks-5a814d9.md).

The BSP runtime is not used at runtime and SAPUI5-specific request handlers are used instead. Therefore, the flow logic ABAP parts cannot be used as they are not executed at runtime.

The SAPUI5 text repository is part of the SAPUI5 ABAP repository. It's intended to be used as fallback mechanism if translation by properties files is not possible.

> ### Note:  
> SAPUI5 distribution layer artifacts, such as control libraries, are not stored in the SAPUI5 ABAP repository, but in a separate repository \(technically based on the MIME repository\). The runtime access is realized by SAPUI5-specific request handlers.

The following design time tools use the SAPUI5 ABAP repository:

-   SAP Business Application Studio
-   SAP Web IDE
-   Special SAPUI5 repository upload and download reports
-   OData services

For more information, see [Design Time Aspects](design-time-aspects-fde0f86.md).



**Further Features of the SAPUI5 ABAP Back-End Infrastructure**

-   SAPUI5 application index addressing the following:

    -   Indexing content of the descriptor for applications, components, and libraries \(for example, used by SAP Fiori apps\)
    -   Cache busting on the level of single and multiple application resources

    Fore more information, see [SAPUI5 Application Index](sapui5-application-index-c5e7098.md).

-   Cache busting on the level of single and multiple application resources

    Which cache busting mechanisms are used, and in which cases, depends on the SAPUI5 app.

    For more information, see [Cache Behavior for Application Resources](cache-behavior-for-application-resources-5449990.md) and [Cache Buster for SAPUI5 Application Resources](cache-buster-for-sapui5-application-resources-4cfe7ef.md).
