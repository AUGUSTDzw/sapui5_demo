## Generating Apps Using Templates

SAP Fiori tools offers a number of templates that you can use to quickly create an SAP Fiori app. These templates are available both for SAP Fiori elements apps and freestyle SAPUI5 apps. The following templates are available:

-   Basic \(freestyle SAPUI5\)

    The basic template serves as a starting point when you want to start from scratch, but also want to make sure that everything is set up properly.

-   Worklist \(SAP Fiori elements\)

    A worklist displays a collection of items to be processed by the user and usually involves reviewing details of a list item and taking action.

-   List Report Object Page \(SAP Fiori elements\)

    With the list report object page, users can view and work with and acting on a large set of items.

-   Analytical List Page \(SAP Fiori elements\)

-   Overview Page \(SAP Fiori elements\)

    The overview page is a data-driven app type and floorplan that provides all the information the user needs on a single page.

-   Form Entry Object Page \(SAP Fiori elements\)
