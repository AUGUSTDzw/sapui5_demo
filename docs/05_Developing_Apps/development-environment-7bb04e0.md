## UI5 Tooling

[UI5 Tooling](https://sap.github.io/ui5-tooling/) is an open and modular toolchain to develop state-of-the-art SAPUI5 applications. As a modern build and development environment it comes with a [command line interface \(CLI\)](https://sap.github.io/ui5-tooling/pages/CLI/), leverages Node.js and npm, and is being further advanced as an open-source project.

Follow the concise [Getting Started](https://sap.github.io/ui5-tooling/pages/GettingStarted/) documentation for initial project setup.

[Consuming SAPUI5 libraries](https://sap.github.io/ui5-tooling/pages/SAPUI5/) is made easy by automatically downloading all required framework dependencies of a project.
