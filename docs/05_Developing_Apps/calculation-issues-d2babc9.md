To access the application log, choose *View â€¦ Logs* in the report `/UI5/APP_INDEX_CALCULATE`. The application log is also persisted in client 000 by default and can be analyzed using transaction `SLG1`.

Technically, the application log is referenced by the object `/UI5/APPIDX`. This object has the following subobjects:

Component-related messages from a consistency check carried out at the end of the calculation of the index

The consistency check includes the following:

-   Whether the same component ID is contained in more than one repository

-   Whether the component ID is valid

-   Whether a reuse component defined in the dependencies is not contained in the application index


The external ID is the component ID.
