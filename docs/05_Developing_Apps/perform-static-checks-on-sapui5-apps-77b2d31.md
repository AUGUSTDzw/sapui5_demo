# Perform Static Checks on SAPUI5 Apps

As of SAP Fiori technology release 1911, you can perform static checks on SAPUI5 apps that you have created.

The static checks verify the following:

-   Does the SAPUI5 app exist in the SAPUI5 ABAP repository?
-   Is the SAPUI5 app active?
-   Does the corresponding ICF node exist under `/sap/bc/ui5_ui5`?

These checks have been delivered via the Code Inspector. For more information, call transaction `SCI` and click on the <span class="SAP-icons-V5">îˆ‚</span> button. In the Performace Assistant window, click on the link in **For more information, see the extended help in Code Inspector.** The extended help describes how you can perform the above checks for your own SAPUI5 apps.
