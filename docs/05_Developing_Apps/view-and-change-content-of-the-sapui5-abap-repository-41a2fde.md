# View and Change Content of the SAPUI5 ABAP Repository

You can create and change customer content in the SAPUI5 ABAP repository. You can also retrieve content from the SAPUI5 ABAP repository to view it.

> ### Note:  
> Changes to content that is delivered by SAP in the SAPUI5 ABAP repository in customer systems are not supported. Extension concepts exist that allow custom enhancements of content that is delivered by SAP. This depends on the type of the content \(see the documentation in question\). For example, see the extensibility information for SAP Fiori for SAP Business Suite on SAP Help Portal at [http://help.sap.com/fiori](http://help.sap.com/fiori) under *SAP Fiori Implementation Information* \> *Extensibility Information*.
