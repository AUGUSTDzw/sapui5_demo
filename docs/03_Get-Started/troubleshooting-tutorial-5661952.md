For example, the SAPUI5 tools can help you with the following tasks:

-   Inspect and debug apps

-   Examine bugs and analyze errors

-   Simulate UI changes

-   Find out how to improve performance


To help you practice using the tools, we created an app with errors that we will use throughout the tutorial. You can view and download the app in the Demo Kitat [Troubleshooting](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.ui.core.tutorial.troubleshooting/sample/sap.ui.core.tutorial.troubleshooting.01).
