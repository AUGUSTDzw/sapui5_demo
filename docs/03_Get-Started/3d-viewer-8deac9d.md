# 3D Viewer

In this tutorial, you will learn how to work with the controls in the Visual Interaction toolkit \(`sap.ui.vk` library\) to create applications with 3D viewing functionality.

The Visual Interaction toolkit provides controls for the visualization of 3D models in your application.

> ### Tip:  
> You do not have to do the tutorial steps sequentially. You can start the tutorial at any step you want, but you just need to ensure that you have downloaded all the relevant code required to work through the step.
> 
> You can view and download the files for all 3D Viewer steps at [3D Viewer](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.ui.vk.tutorial.VIT).

Prerequisite steps for the 3D Viewer tutorial.
-   **[Step 1: 3D Viewer With Single File Loading](step-1-3d-viewer-with-single-file-loading-0e21912.md "In this step, you will be creating a 3D Viewer application that allows a user to load
        a single 2D image or 3D model that is stored locally or remotely.")**  
In this step, you will be creating a 3D Viewer application that allows a user to load a single 2D image or 3D model that is stored locally or remotely.
-   **[Step 2: 3D Viewer With Multiple File Loading](step-2-3d-viewer-with-multiple-file-loading-80b0b57.md "In this step, you will be creating a Viewer application that allows a user to load
        multiple 3D resources stored locally.")**  
In this step, you will be creating a Viewer application that allows a user to load multiple 3D resources stored locally.
-   **[Step 3: 3D Viewer Using the Viewport Control](step-3-3d-viewer-using-the-viewport-control-112d7b4.md "In this step, you will be creating a 3D Viewer application using the
            sap.ui.vk.Viewport control.")**  
In this step, you will be creating a 3D Viewer application using the `sap.ui.vk.Viewport` control.
-   **[Step 4: Adding a Scene Tree](step-4-adding-a-scene-tree-773a008.md "In this step, you will be adding an sap.ui.vk.SceneTree control to
        your 3D Viewer application.")**  
In this step, you will be adding an `sap.ui.vk.SceneTree` control to your 3D Viewer application.
-   **[Step 5: Adding View Gallery](step-5-adding-view-gallery-ad2578a.md "In this step, you will be adding the sap.ui.vk.ViewGallery control
        to a 3D Viewer application. ")**  
In this step, you will be adding the `sap.ui.vk.ViewGallery` control to a 3D Viewer application.
