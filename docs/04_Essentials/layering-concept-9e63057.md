# Layering Concept

SAPUI5 flexibility uses a consistent layering concept to store the UI changes as semantic delta information. This layering concept applies consistently to all users of SAPUI5 flexibility \(end users, key users, and developers\).

The delta changes are stored in a repository, called *layered repository*, as it contains different layers where the UI changes of the different users are stored in respective layers. Here's an overview:


<table>
<tr>

</tr>
</table>

The semantic changes are attached to stable IDs. This makes them upgrade-safe, for example, if the controls of the app get exchanged.

**How are the layered changes stored?**

The changes are stored in the respective layers separately from the original content that remains unchanged. The repository stores the logical information for the changes that are to be applied to the original entity in a JSON-based file. The repository calls the client API to create, update, and delete these changes and calls the REST services to update the back-end system.

Stable means that the IDs are concatenated with the application component ID and do not have any auto-generated parts.")
