You can export the table entries for configurations and text pools. An export results in the following files:

-   By exporting a configuration, you create a configuration file in JSON format. This format is required, for example, to be able to transport a configuration between different systems.

-   By exporting a text pool, you create a text file in .properties format. This format is necessary to be able to translate the texts. Exporting is also useful to create a backup copy of your configurations and texts.


> ### Note:  
> In SAP S/4HANA Cloud, you must use the apps *Export Software Collection* and *Import Collection* to transport a configuration between different systems.

To use the export function, proceed as follows:

1.  Navigate into an application.
2.  Select a configuration.
3.  Click *Export* in the footer toolbar.
4.  Download the configuration file.
5.  Download the text properties file.
