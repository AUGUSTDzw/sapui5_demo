# APF Modules

Analysis Path Framework \(APF\) is an SAPUI5 component that can be used as a foundation for creating analytical Web applications. APF has a public API that supports the following:

-   Building a Web application by using predefined UI elements

-   Configuring the Web application

-   Creating and processing analysis paths

-   Displaying data, for example, in interactive charts

-   Interaction between UI and path processing

-   Error and message handling

-   Interaction with the server using OData services

-   Saving analysis paths on the server


Internally, APF consists of the following submodules:

-   `sap.apf.core`
-   `sap.apf.ui`

The `sap.apf.core` module defines the foundation for analysis path processing. The `sap.apf.ui` module defines the UI and the rendering of the analysis path on the UI. It depends on the `sap.apf.core` module.
