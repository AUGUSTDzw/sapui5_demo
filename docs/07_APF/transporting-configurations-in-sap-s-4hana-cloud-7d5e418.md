# Transporting Configurations in SAP S/4HANA Cloud

In SAP S/4HANA Cloud, you must use the apps *Export Software Collection* and *Import Collection* to transport configurations between systems. Whenever you create, change, or delete a configuration, a notification is created in the system. You can then use these apps to transport the files.

> ### Note:  
> If you just want to create a backup copy of your files, you can use the export function of the APF Configuration Modeler and don't need the apps *Export Software Collection* and *Import Collection*.

To find the configuration you want to export in the *Import Collection* app, you can search, for example, for “Analysis Path Framework”, the configuration name, or the configuration GUID.

For more information, see the documentation for your Cloud version at [https://help.sap.com/viewer/p/SAP\_S4HANA\_CLOUD](https://help.sap.com/viewer/p/SAP_S4HANA_CLOUD) under *Product Assistance* \> **<language\>** \> *Generic Information* \> *General Functions for the Key User* \> *Extensibility*, chapters *Export Software Collection* and *Import Collection*.
