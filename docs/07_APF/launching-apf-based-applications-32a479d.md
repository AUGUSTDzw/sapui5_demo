# Launching APF-Based Applications

You can launch an APF-based application in the following ways:

-   From a Smart Business KPI tile

    You can configure a Smart Business KPI tile so that an APF-based application is used for drill-down.

-   From a Fiori app launcher tile

    You can use a Fiori app launcher tile to launch your APF-based application. However, this is not supported if you use the generic APF runtime application.
