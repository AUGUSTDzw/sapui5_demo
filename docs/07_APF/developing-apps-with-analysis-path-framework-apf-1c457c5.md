# Developing Apps with Analysis Path Framework \(APF\)

Analysis Path Framework \(APF\) provides reuse components that allow you to build and enhance interactive analytical Web applications.

You can use APF-based applications to explore KPIs and their influencing factors by drilling down into multidimensional representations of data, such as charts or tables.

APF is available with:

-   SAP Business Suite powered by SAP HANA

-   SAP S/4HANA




## Key Features

The key features of APF include the following:

-   APF-based applications:

    -   SAP Fiori applications for a data driven, chart-based drill-down analysis targeted at business users

    -   Step-by-step analysis of data by building analysis paths using a set of preconfigured analysis steps
    -   Select data to filter the information provided in subsequent steps

    -   Save, retrieve, and print analysis paths

    -   Use of OData services to expose the data on the UI. Each step can have its own OData service so that you can define cross-scenarios that use data from different application areas or systems.

    -   Supported data sources for the OData services:

        -   Calculation views

        -   ABAP CDS views
        -   BW OData queries


-   APF Configuration Modeler:

    -   Enables you to create your own APF-based applications in a very quick and easy way and to enhance shipped applications.

    -   Configure an APF-based app without having to code:

        -   Choose from predefined UI elements, such as chart types, tables, and filters. APF takes care of the interaction between these UI elements.

        -   Assign OData services to analysis steps or filters, for example. APF then takes care of the OData request handling, such as when a request is triggered and how it is parameterized.


    -   Execute APF-based applications directly from the APF Configuration Modeler using the generic runtime application provided by APF.

    -   In SAP S/4HANA, the APF Configuration Modeler provides in-app help to get context-sensitive user assistance for individual entry fields.


-   Integration

    -   Integration with SAP Fiori and SAP Smart Business, which allows you to launch APF-based applications from different tiles or other apps, handing over filters and parameters to the APF-based application.
    -   Navigation from APF-based applications to other apps, for example, to view additional information or to take action in a transactional app, handing over filters and parameters of the APF-based application to the target application.
