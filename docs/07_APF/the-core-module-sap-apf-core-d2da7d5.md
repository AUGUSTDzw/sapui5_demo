# The Core Module \(sap.apf.core\)

The core module \(`sap.apf.core`\) has a public API that supports the following:

-   Loading an analytical configuration and other static resources

-   Creating an analysis step from the given configuration

-   Creating OData requests

-   Adding a step to an analysis path

-   Manipulating, processing, and updating the analysis path and its steps

-   Creating filters and setting a context

-   Interaction between APF and an external Web application \(UI\), for example, by passing callback functions

-   Error handling and sending error messages to a registered handler

-   Saving and retrieving a named analysis path on the server

-   Extending possible configurations by new representation entities


The core component contains the entire logic for path processing, but no UI logic. For more information, see [Analysis Path Processing](analysis-path-processing-f7da7d5.md).
