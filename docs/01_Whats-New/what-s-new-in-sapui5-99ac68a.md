**TypeScript can now be used productively in SAPUI5**

TypeScript is an extension of JavaScript that adds type information to the language. It helps developers catch errors early through type checking and by providing code assist in supporting code editors, for example through code completion and inline documentation. TypeScript can now be used productively in SAPUI5, and we encourage you to use it for an improved development efficiency and experience.
