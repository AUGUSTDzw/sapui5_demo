# Using Images, Initials, and Icons

SAP Fiori elements supports the use of images, initials, and icons.

> ### Note:  
> You can use the SAPUI5 Visual Editor to replace the default icon by any SAP icon.

The system follows this logic for choosing a display option for an object:

 ![](images/Avatar_e9e8ed2.jpg) 

> ### Note:  
> In the object page's header, the header image is an avatar control. By default, the avatar is rendered as a square. If the avatar's source, initials, or icon isn't set or found, a fallback placeholder is displayed. The type of placeholder depends on the shape of the avatar. If the avatar is circular, a person icon is shown. If the avatar is a square, a product icon is shown.
