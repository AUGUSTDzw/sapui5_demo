# How To Use SAP Fiori Elements

Creating an app with SAP Fiori elements generally consists of the following steps:

-   Prerequisites for using SAP Fiori elements

    You access the required back-end system information in your app using OData services.

    For more information, see [Prerequisites for Using SAP Fiori Elements](prerequisites-for-using-sap-fiori-elements-f2344b5.md).

-   Prepare UI annotations

    You use annotations to enable or modify certain default features and functionality.

    For more information, see [Working With UI Annotations](working-with-ui-annotations-83c89cc.md).

-   Build UI applications

    We recommend that you use [SAP Fiori tools](https://help.sap.com/viewer/product/SAP_FIORI_tools/Latest/en-US), which is a set of extensions for SAP Business Application Studio and Visual Studio Code, to build your apps.

    In SAP Fiori elements for OData V2, you can also use SAP Web IDE to build UI applications when using SAP Fiori elements.

    > ### Caution:  
    > SAP Web IDE is no longer available via SAP Business Technology Platform trial accounts. Any references to SAP Web IDE in this documentation are only relevant for you if you have access to SAP Web IDE through a productive SAP BTP account. Please consider SAP Business Application Studio as an alternative. See [App Development Using SAP Business Application Studio](../03_Get-Started/app-development-using-sap-business-application-studio-6bbad66.md).

    For more information about SAP Web IDE, see the documentation for SAP Web IDE on the SAP Help Portal at [https://help.sap.com/viewer/p/SAP\_Web\_IDE](https://help.sap.com/viewer/p/SAP_Web_IDE).

    For more information, including details about mandatory and optional post-generation tasks, see [Building an App](building-an-app-9834a0a.md).

-   Extend SAP Fiori elements-based apps

    As an optional step, you can extend your app if needed, that is, in cases in which the manifest settings or annotations do not allow you to achieve the desired app behavior.

    For more information, see [Extending SAP Fiori Elements-Based Apps](extending-sap-fiori-elements-based-apps-358cf25.md).
